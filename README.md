Project Approach
1. Data Understanding & Exploration

Explored dataset structure, variables, and quality.

Performed EDA to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.

2. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing or inconsistent values.

Converted Date and Time into a unified DateTime column.

Created additional features like daily averages, peak-hour usage, and rolling averages.

Scaled features for improved model performance.

3. Feature Engineering

Selected relevant features for predicting Global_active_power.

Optionally integrated external factors (e.g., weather).

4. Model Selection & Training

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Trained regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

Compared models to select the best-performing one.

Performed feature importance analysis to highlight key influencers.
